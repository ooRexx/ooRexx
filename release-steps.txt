2022-12-15, Release Steps for ooRexx 5.0.0 as a role model

- create a branch for 5.0.0 using current trunk (if no show stopper errors occur
  running the ooRexx testsuite) for
      "main/trunk" to "main/branches" and
      "test/trunk" to "test/branches",
      not yet for the docs (see below)

  here the svn command for code and test (replace "userId" with yours)

        svn copy --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/trunk svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/branches/5.0.0  -m "Creating code branch 5.0.0 to prepare release."
        svn copy --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/trunk svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/branches/5.0.0 -m "Creating test branch 5.0.0 to prepare release."

- update the ooRexx version related information in trunk to "5.1.0"

  cf. <http://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12539> changes to:

        main/trunk/CMakeLists.txt   -- update the release version information to the next release.
           See https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12539/#diff-1 for the types of changes required.
        main/trunk/platform/windows/rexx32.exe.manifest
        main/trunk/platform/windows/rexx64.exe.manifest

  and cf. <http://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12540>

        main/trunk/api/oorexxapi.h  -- Add a new version identifier define for the new release.
           See https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/12540/ for an example

- *before* creating the docs branches/5.0.0, the necessary steps:

        - make sure all authors who have committed in the meantime are listed in their appropriate
          ${book}/en-US/Author_Group.xml; to detect one can use tools/listAuthorsAsOfLate.rex

        - make sure that ${book}/revision_info.txt has the latest revision information
          of real updates to ${book}/en-US/*.xml files; one approach to update that file
          is to first delete it, then run "updateEntityValues.rex -y 2022 -e "2022.12.25" -r 99999 .."
          which will recreate ${book}/revision_info.txt

        - make sure that all copyright texts are updated (you can use tools/updateCopyright.rex)

- create the docs branch for 5.0.0 using current "docs/trunk" to "docs/branches/5.0.0"

  here the svn command for code, documentation and test (replace "userId" with yours)

        svn copy --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/trunk svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/branches/5.0.0 -m "Creating docs branch 5.0.0 to prepare release."

- update the ooRexx documentation in trunk to not show *CHG* and *NEW* for 50 anymore

??   this may be as easy as changing the entity definitions
??
??       <!ENTITY added50 "*NEW* ">
??       <!ENTITY changed50 "*CHG* ">
??   to
??       <!ENTITY added50 "">
??       <!ENTITY changed50 "">
??
??   and to add for new additions and changes in the documentation
??
??       <!ENTITY added51 "*NEW* ">
??       <!ENTITY changed51 "*CHG* ">
??
??   in the files: rexxapi/en-US/rexxapi.ent, rexxpg/en-US/rexxpg.ent, rexxref/en-US/rexxref.ent,
??   winextensions/en-US/winextensions.ent

- Suggestion for a time table:

    t0: if the tests on Jenkins show no show-stopper errors from the latest trunk, then create the branch: ASAP
    t1: apply the necessary changes in the branch (version information update, release information update):  < =(t0+7 days)
    t2: create the installation packages from the branch and upload them to a staged directory "5.0.0": after a week (t1+1)
    t3: communicate the availability: t2+1

- create on Sourceforge:

        oorexx/files/5.1.0beta        ... to receive the new builds from trunk
        oorexx/oorexx-docs/5.1.0beta  ... to receive the new documentation from trunk

        oorexx/files/5.0.0_Release_Candidate        ... to receive the tested builds from branches/5.0.0
        oorexx/oorexx-docs/5.0.0_Release_Candidate  ... to receive the new documentation from trunk

- adjust the build scripts on Jenkins and feed the 5.0.0_Release_Candidate and the 5.1.0beta folders
  for code and documentation

- release information:

        update branches/5.0.0/NOTICES to reflect the current copyright year

        update branches/5.0.0./CHANGES (a text file) to document all changes from the last release
        for

                - Bugs
                - Feature-requests
                - Documentation
                - Patches

        1) all items with the status "accepted" need to be checked to see whether they
           have been worked on such that they can be changed to "pending". Accepted generally
           means code changes have been made, so these should be included in the changes.
           A decision needs to be made on whether the incomplete portions of the item (generally
           doc or test work) need to be completed prior to the release.

        2) all items with the status "pending" get included in CHANGES (the text file
           located in trunk)

??      3) all items with the status "pending" get changed to "closed"

        4) a "Milestone 5.1.0" and "5.0.1" (for potential buf fix releases) needs to be
           created, just did it, here the steps needed for "Bugs":

                - pick "Administration"
                - click on the lock icon in the upper hand corner
                - click on the "Tickets" menu and then on the changed config "icon"
                  left of the text "Bugs"
                - choose "Field Management"
                - add "5.1.0" to "Milestones" which represents ooRexx version numbers
                  offered when new bugs get created

??                ... this option page would allow to delete Milestones; which ones
                      should we delete. RKM I would be in favor of deleting all of the 3.x.x labels,
                      the list is getting a bit long. Also a few junk ones like vX.X.X.

- release

        - rename the folders from "5.0.0_Release_Candidate" to "5.0.0"

        - Update the Sourceforge default download links to point to the new releases

        - announce the new release on the ooRexx related e-mail lists,
          RexxLA e-mail list, BSF4ooRexx related e-mail lists, Open Object Rexx Facebook page,
          comp.lang.rexx

          - ask the reader to forward the announcement to related e-mail lists
            they participate (like the various IBM e-mail lists, other related
            open-source e-mail lists and projects)

        - use "svn move" to move main/branches/5.0.0 to main/releases/5.0.0, do the same
          for the documentation (docs/branches/5.0.0 to docs/releases/5.0.0) and tests

            svn move --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/branches/5.0.0 svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/releases/5.0.0 -m "Creating main/releases/5.0.0 to conclude release process."
            svn move --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/branches/5.0.0 svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/docs/releases/5.0.0 -m "Creating docs/releases/5.0.0 to conclude release process."
            svn move --username=userId svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/branches/5.0.0 svn+ssh://orexx@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/releases/5.0.0 -m "Creating test/releases/5.0.0 to conclude release process."

        - change into docs/trunk/tools and run

             updateEntityValues.rex -y 2023 -v "5.0.0 -> 5.1.0" -e "2023.01.01" -r 99999 ..


- overall timetable estimate:

        - t0: if the tests on Jenkins show no show-stopper errors from the latest
              trunk, then create the branch

        - t1: create the installation packages from the branch and upload them to a
              staged directory "5.0.0"

        - t2: apply the necessary changes in the branch (version information update,
              release information update): within (t0+7) days the longest

        - t3: communicate the availability: t2+1

        - t4: once the release has been finalized, create a x.x.(n+1) branch from the release branche
              to be used for potential bug fix releases. This includes updating the release number information
              in the build.
??            move the "main|docs|test"/branches/5.0.0 to "main|docs|test"/releases/5.0.0

------------

Before any new release go through the tools used for documentation build to make sure they are still up to date; make any changes BEFORE a specific version is frozen to avoid double copying to release and trunk

Same for all platforms that we are currently building, work through all build and test "Projects" on Jenkins and note any build that fail (and the reason therefor) and any tests that are excluded (with a hint to a bug report if available)

------------

In order to get the correct documentation added to Windows and macOS installers it is imperative to build the documentation BEFORE the final build of code is triggered. The documentation need around one hour to complete when all documents are built so withing that time no build of code should be triggered.

A better way to do the release would possibly be to NOT change anything on Jenkins but leave the builds from trunk and then when it is agreed to release a specific revision to manually copy that revision on sourceforge using sftp. The burst of activity AFTER the agreement to go GA caused a lof of additional work, all that should be done in trunk

------------

TODO List for ooRexx 5 after a release is done

After release Jenkins shold go back to trunk

For Build Projects change

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/branches/5.0.0
TO
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/trunk

For Test Projects change

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/branches/5.0.0

to

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/test/trunk

Change Jenkins upload go to oorexx/5.1.0beta/ -> in Uploading script

Change Jenkins doc upload go to oorexx-docs/5.1.0beta/ -> in Docbuild Project

Set Windows  & MacOS to build only AFTER documentation has been built

Try to make sure everything is driven from CMake

Problem 1:
For Windows build currently the url for downloading the documentation is hardcoded in downloaddocs.bat (C:/downloaddocs/downloaddocs.bat)

Proposed solution: Make url an input to the script -> %1 (there are other input)
Preferably the url should come out of CMakeLists.txt
Temporary solution: still hardcoded but reading from oorexx-docs/5.0.0 (later 5.1.0beta)

Problem 2:
For MacOS build there is a script created at build time that is used post-build to create the installer. Also in this script the downloadpath for documentation is hardcoded

Proposed solution: Define a variable defining the downloadpath for documentation in CMakelists.txt that can be used in the script
Temporary solution: still hardcoded but reading from oorexx-docs/5.0.0 (later 5.1.0beta)

Problem 3:
oorexx-docs-bildutils folder on sourceforge is not automatically updated.

Temporary solution: use SFTP to upload the latest tools
Long term solution: check if this can be made a "Project" in Jenkins

Problem 4:
oorexx-buildutils is also not automatically updated. Further only Windows tools are present.

Temporary solution: use SFTP to upload the latest tools
Long term solution: a "Project" in Jenkins + Further tools for macOS and Linux/Unix

Problem 5:
In oorexx-docs/5.0.0 folder on SF the Readme.txt is missing

Solution: create a Readme.txt and try to set date to release date 2022-12-23

Problem 6:
In oorexx-docs/5.0.0 folder on SF the Readme.txt is not displayed ( a link to another document is not shown)

Solution fix the link

Problem 7:
oorexx-docs/5.0.0beta documentation is still present
Solved: Remove folder after having backed it up
(but 4.1 and earlier documentation is still missing)

Problem 8:
oorexx/5.0.0_Release_Candidate is still present
Solved: folder removed after having backed it up

Problem 9:
oorexx/5.0.0beta is still present
Solved: folder removed after having backed it up

Further problems found 2022-12-28

On several *nix platforms the installer build is tested after build

sudo rpm --upgrade ooRexx-5.0.0-*.rpm || true
rpm --query --info "ooRexx-5.0.0-*"
sudo rpm --erase "ooRexx-5.0.0-*"
sudo rpm --install ooRexx-5.0.0-*.rpm

Problem 1: all these settings must be manually edited.
Problem 2: testing the upgrade option is a good thing but at a change from 5.0.0 to 5.1.0 this will not succeed, the error will look like this

CPack: Create package
CPackRPM: Will use GENERATED spec file: /home/osboxes/workspace/ooRexx-CentOS9-build/oorexxBuild/_CPack_Packages/Linux/RPM/SPECS/ooRexx.spec
CPack: - package: /home/osboxes/workspace/ooRexx-CentOS9-build/oorexxBuild/ooRexx-5.1.0-12588.centos9.x86_64.rpm generated.
+ pkill rxapi
+ sudo rpm --upgrade ooRexx-5.1.0-12588.centos9.x86_64.rpm
	package ooRexx-5.0.1-12588.x86_64 is already installed
+ true
+ rpm --query --info 'ooRexx-5.1.0-*'
package ooRexx-5.1.0-* is not installed
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
Archiving artifacts
Finished: FAILURE

Hence the old 5.0.0 (5.0.1?) must be deleted manually.

Problem 3: in the uploading script there is a ::constant ooRexxID defined as '5.0.0-'
This must also be manually changed at a change from 5.0.0 -> 5.1.0

Short term solution to 1: Manually editing every script and changing 5.0.0 -> 5.1.0 (DONE)
Long term solution: make the naming of the installer from a variable read, preferably from CMakeLists.txt

Solution to 2: Manually visiting all *nix platforms and uninstalling earlier versions of oorexx; avoid using the "update" option in testing the installer; In the build process install artifact once query info and uninstall it before leaving (the test job is done from the built ooRexx, not the installed ooRexx)

Short term solution to 3: manually editing uploading script
Long term solution: read a variable  during upload rather than using a constant

----

Consider one additional zipped documentation item with the complete documentation available for download

The release version should not display the revision number. -> find out how to achieve this.

Revision numbers are part of the installer filenames (controlled by CMake) -> find out how to achieve this
