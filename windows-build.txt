                    Building Open Object Rexx on Windows
                    ====================================

Please read ALL of these notes, to be sure you understand your options,
before building ooRexx.  These notes cover building the 3.x and 4.x versions
of ooRexx.  (In this document the term "builder" is used to refer to the
person building ooRexx from source.)

Obtaining the source
====================

SVN:  Anonymous check out of the ooRexx source is available from
SourceForge using Subversion.  SourceForge also has documentation on
obtaining and using a Subversion client.  A pre-compiled Subversion client
for Windows can be obtained from:

  http://subversion.tigris.org/

Use this command to check out a copy of the head revision of ooRexx 3.x:

  svn co https://oorexx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/oorexx/interpreter-3.x/trunk interpreter

The 'interpreter' at the end of the command will be the root directory of
the source tree.  This directory can be given any name.

Release Source File Archive:  Download from SourceForge the archive desired,
for instance, ooRexx-4.0.0.zip or ooRexx-4.2.0.zip, and unzip it in a work
directory.

Build Requirements
==================

Some of these items are optional, have alternatives, or have caveats.  The
options, alternatives, or caveats are discussed at the relevant point in the
build instructions.

[Required] Visual C++ .NET 2003 (known also as Visual C++ 7.1), plus service
packs, or later.  Visual C++ 2005 is a good choice.

Note:
-----
Visual C++ 6.0 is no longer supported and the code base will not compile
using that version of Visual C++. Microsoft releases a free C++ complier under
the Visual Studio Express label. More information and download options are
available on Microsoft's website here:

  http://www.microsoft.com/express/

[Required] Microsoft Platform SDK February 2003, or later.  A later version
of the SDK is preferable.

Note:  Microsoft has switched from calling the SDK the "Platform SDK" to the
"Windows SDK."  In the following text, substitute Windows SDK for Platform SDK
if needed.

The environment variables for the C++ compiler and the Platform SDK *MUST*
be set correctly to build ooRexx.  See the Environment set up section below
for details.

Note: The release ooRexx, built by the project team, is built using Visual
C++ 2005 and the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK.  However, ooRexx
builds without problems using later versions of these tools.  For instance,
ooRexx can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and the latest
version of the Windows SDK.  In addition, ooRexx will build using the free
Visual C++ Express editions.

Microsoft has the tendency to move the download URL for the SDKs, often.  A
good starting point for locating a SDK is:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK

[Optional] The Windows build-utilities package.

Note: This package is part of the ooRexx project and is available from
SourceForge on the download page.  The package contains pre-compiled
binaries that can be used to meet some of the other requirements of the
build process.  For instance, the package contains a process killer and a
touch program.

[Required] Some form of a process killer.

Note: The build process uses killer.exe, available in the build-utilities
package.  However, other process killers can be used by editing some of the
build batch files.  For instance, on XP systems taskkill is part of the OS.
If building on an XP system, the builder could edit the batch file(s) and
replace killer with taskkill.

[Required] Some form of a touch program, or Xalan/Xerces.

Note: When using source checked out from SVN, 'touching' the proper files
negates the necessity of having Xalan available.  The easiest approach here
is to use the touchheaders.bat file provided in the source.  This batch file
uses stouch.exe which is provided in the build-utilities package.

Nothing is needed if building from a Release Source File archive.  The
proper files have already been 'touched' in the archive.  (Unless the
builder makes changes to the messages source in the build source tree.)

Xalan/Xerces is needed if the builder is making changes to the ooRexx
message files.  This would be a *rare* case.  However, pre-compiled versions
of Xalan and Xerces for Windows are easy to obtain.  Xalan version 1.1.0 and
Xerces version 2.7.0 are needed.  Obtain the binaries from the links below
and put them in a location in the path.

  http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/index.html

  http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/

[Optional]  Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)

Note: NSIS is used to build the Windows installer package.  It is only
needed if the builder wants to also create the installer package.  Detailed
notes on obtaining and installing NSIS are in the Build section.

Building ooRexx
===============

On Windows, the process of building ooRexx is mostly the same whether
building from a release source file archive or building from a svn checkout.
Once the source tree is installed on a system, this file is in the top-level
directory of the tree.

Initial set up
--------------

* Check out or download / unzip the ooRexx source.

* Install the C++ compiler and Platform SDK

* If using the build utilities, download the current Windows package and
place the binaries somewhere in the path.

* If using Xalan download the Xalan and Xerces binaries and unzip them into
their desired location.  Add the bin directory of both packages to the path.

* If creating the Windows Installer package, download and configure NSIS.

Environment set up
-----------------

* Set the ooRexx build batch file variables.

Set SRC_DIR to the top-level directory of the source tree.  Set SRC_DRV to
the drive letter of the drive the source is located on.  For example:

F:\>set SRC_DIR=\interpreter-3.x
F:\>set SRC_DRV=E:

* Set the environment variables for the C++ compiler and the Platform SDK.

Depending on how the builder has installed these tools, the environment
variables may be already set in the System environment.  However, it is more
common to run the batch files provided by the tools.

The environment variables for the C++ compiler and the Platform SDK *MUST*
be set correctly to build ooRexx.

Over the years Microsoft has changed the name and location of the batch
files provided with the compiler and SDK tools.  Plus this process is
dependent on the options the individual chooses when installing the tools.
Because of this it is not feasible to describe every single variation of how
to properly set the environment for the Microsoft tools.

Nevertheless, the general procedure is the same.  Run the compiler batch
file first, then the SDK batch file.  The builder needs to determine the
exact steps for her specific system, but as an example:

F:\>call F:\Tools\MsVisualStudio.2005\VC\vcvarsall.bat x86
F:\>call F:\Tools\MsPlatformSDK\SetEnv.cmd  /XP32 /RETAIL

Important:
----------

Later versions of Visual C++ and the Windows SDK use a feature called delayed
environment expansion in their set up scripts.  But, often delayed expansion
is turned off.  This causes problems, the set up scripts do not work.  The
easist way to fix this is to edit the registry:

Using regedit, edit the following REG_DWORD value in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\DelayedExpansion

set it to 0x1

If the DelayedExpansion value is not already there then just add it.

NOTE - Building 64-bit ooRexx:
-----------------------------
ooRexx can be built as a 32-bit or 64-bit application with no changes to the
ooRexx source code.  Whether a 32-bit or 64-bit ooRexx is built is
determined by how the builder sets up the Visual C++ environment.

To build the 64-bit version, use the 64-bit compiler tools.  The 64-bit
compiler tools are used when the builder provides the correct options to
vcvarsall.bat and / or SetEnv.cmd.  To determine the options use the /?
arg.  For example:

C:\home\Tools\Visual.Studio.8\VC\vcvarsall.bat /?

In general, the amd64 option is what is needed to use the 64-bit tools.
This may vary depending on the exact version of VC++ and the SDK.

Build
-----

The Windows build is controlled by batch files.  These batch files in turn
invoke nMake.

* Change to the top-level of the source directory.

* If building from SVN source, and not using Xalan, touch the appropriate
message files.  (This is only necessary the very first time after an initial
check out.)

* Run makeorx with the appropriate arguments.

For example:

F:\>e:
E:\>cd \main\trunk
E:\trunk>touchheaders
E:\trunk>makeorx NODEBUG

Build Notes and Caveats
=======================

makeorx.bat
----------

makeorx takes one required argument and two optional arguments.  If your
execute makeorx without any arguments, the correct syntax will be printed.
That in and of itself may be sufficient to use the makeorx batch correctly.
The following is more detail on the arguments.

The first required argument is exactly one of: NODEBUG DEBUG BOTH.

The second optional argument, if used, must be exactly: PACKAGE.

The third optional argument can be the path where the ooRexx documentation
files can be located if they are not in the default location.  See the
PACKAGE notes a little further down for more detail.

First option: NODEBUG DEBUG BOTH

NODEBUG causes a non-debug version to be built, DEBUG causes a debug version
to be built, and BOTH will build both.  For a non-debug version, the built
files are placed in .\Win32Rel, for instance E:\interpreter-3.x\Win32Rel.
Debug version files are placed in .\Win32Dbg.

Second option: PACKAGE

The optional PACKAGE argument will first run the build(s) and then create
the Windows installer package.  (See the NSIS notes for details on setting
NSIS up correctly.) The installer package files will be placed in the
top-level source directory and will be named: ooRexx<version>_<svn>.exe or
ooRexx<version>_<svn>-debug.exe, where svn is the svn revision number of the
source. For example: ooRexx312_892.exe or ooRexx312_892-debug.exe

In order for the installer package to be built, the ooRexx PDF documentation
files must be in the 'doc' directory of the source tree.  These files and
the doc directory itself do not exist in the source tree, the builder needs
to manually add them.

Before using the PACKAGE option, create the doc directory in the root of the
source tree.  The copy the PDF files into that directory.  Alternatively,
the third option to makeorx can be used to specify a location where the PDF
are located.  makeorx will then create the doc directory and attempt to copy
the files from that location into that directory.

Third option: <Location of documentation files>

The third option can be used to point makeorx to the documentation files if
they are not located in the source tree.  For example, say the PDF files are
located in the C:\ooRexx.4.0.0.release.docs directory.  The following could
be used to build ooRexx and create the installer package without the need to
copy the PDF files into the source tree:

E:\work.ooRexx\makeorx NODEBUG PACKAGE C:\ooRexx.4.0.0.release.docs

Rather than specify the doc location on the command line, an environment
variable can be used.  The following is equivalent to the above command:

E:\work.ooRexx\set DOC_LOCATION=C:\ooRexx.4.0.0.release.docs
E:\work.ooRexx\makeorx NODEBUG PACKAGE

Miscellaneous details:

* The output of the build process is redirected into a log file.  The log
file is named Win32Rel.log or Win32Dbg.log depending on the type of build
and will be located in the .\Win32Rel or .\Win32Dbg directory as
appropriate.  This redirection to a log file can be turned of by setting an
environment variable.  If NO_BUILD_LOG is set to 1, the build output will
not be redirected:

E:\work.ooRexx\set NO_BUILD_LOG=1

* There is no 'clean' option at this time.  To ensure a completely clean
build, delete the respective build directory.  For example, from the
top-level source directory, the following command will ensure a complete
rebuild of the release version:

E:\interpreter-3.x>rd /Q /S Win32Rel

Windows Platform SDK
--------------------

* The February 2003 version of the Platform SDK has a bug in NewAPIs.h.
This bug is fixed in later version of the SDK.  If using the February 2003
SDK, one can either edit the NewAPIs.h file to fix the bug, or replace the
header file with the fixed version from a later SDK.

The error is on line 312 of the file.  To fix it, locate the NewAPIs.h file
in the SDK and change line 312 from:

      BOOL (CALLBACK *RealGetLongPathName)(LPCTSTR, LPTSTR, DWORD);

to:

      DWORD (CALLBACK *RealGetLongPathName)(LPCTSTR, LPTSTR, DWORD);

* The "Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Vista" version of
the Platform SDK no longer supports Windows 95, 98, or NT.  This version of
the SDK can be used to compile ooRexx, but the result may have problems
running on Windows versions previous to Windows 2000 (i.e., Windows NT,
Windows 95, Windows 98, etc.)

In addition, to compile, the file kernel\platform\windows\FileSystem.cpp
will need to be edited to remove the reference to NewAPIs.h.  In
FileSystem.cpp, comment out lines 60 - 62.  For example:

// #define COMPILE_NEWAPIS_STUBS          /* Allows GetLongPathName to run on  */
// #define WANT_GETLONGPATHNAME_WRAPPER   /* NT and Windows 95                 */
// #include <NewAPIs.h>

Process killer
--------------

The Windows batch file(s) need to kill the rxapi.exe process if it is
running.  This is done using killer.exe, which is available in the
build-utilities package of the ooRexx project.  The builder can download
pre-compiled binaries of the build utilities from the project download page.
Or, the source for the build utilities can also be checked out from the SVN
repository and the builder can build her own version of killer.exe.

Alternatively, the batch file(s) can be edited and some other process killer
can be used.  As an example, taskkill.exe is available on Windows XP
systems.  The builder could search for all occurrences of:

  killer rxapi.exe

and replace them with

  taskkill /F /IM rxapi.exe

Whichever process killer is used, it must be available in the path when the
build process is started.

The ooRexx message files
------------------------

Xalan is used to generate a number of files related to the ooRexx messages.
The output files are already generated and included in the source tree.
However, due to a quirk in time stamps, the first time the source is checked
out from SVN the build process will try to call Xalan to generate
(re-generate) these files.  This causes the build to fail if Xalan is not
installed.

If the builder does not want to install Xalan and Xerces, (which is normally
really not necessary,) the solution is to change the time stamp on the
appropriate files.

This is easily done by executing the touchheaders.bat file.  However, this
batch file uses stouch.exe from the build-utilities package.  To use this
method, download the Windows build-utilities package and place the binaries
somewhere in the path.

Alternatively, the builder can manually change the time stamp on the files,
maybe using some other touch utility.  To determine the proper files to
touch, the builder should examine the touchheaders.sh file.

Note: If a developer is making changes to the ooRexx messages, then it *is*
necessary to install Xalan and Xerces to generate the proper output files.
This would not be the normal case.

Packaging with NSIS
-------------------

Requires NSIS 2.0.3 or greater.

The build process using makeorx can automatically create the Windows
installer by using the PACKAGE option.  NSIS needs to be installed correctly
for this to work.

After installing the base NSIS package, do the following:

Be sure makensis.exe is in the path.  This file is located in the top-level
directory of the installed NSIS package.

3 additional NSIS plugins need to be added to the base install.  These files
need to be put into the 'Plugins' subdirectory of the base install.  They
are:

FindProcDLL.dll
KillProcDLL.dll
services.dll

The files can be obtained from the NSIS project at:
