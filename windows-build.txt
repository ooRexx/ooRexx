                    Building Open Object Rexx on Windows
                    ====================================

Please read ALL of these notes before building ooRexx!

On Windows, the process of building ooRexx is the same if building from a
release source file archive or building form a svn checkout.  Once the
source tree is installed on a system, this file is the top-level directory
of the tree.  (Hereafter referred to as <this directory>.)

Requires Microsoft Visual C++ V 6.0 plus service packs
Requires kill.exe

From the current directory (where this file is):

set SRC_DIR=<this directory> eg \oorexx\oorexx
set SRC_DRV=<this drive>     eg d:
makeorx NODEBUG

All files will be built in win32rel

Packaging with NSIS
-------------------

Requires NSIS 2.0.3 or greater.

cd <this directory>\platform\windows
Look at the top of oorexx.nsi and run makensis.exe as explained.

How to setup and start the Build Process for Object REXX on Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Install Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 with the actual service pack.

Unpack all Object REXX source file to the build directory usually "orxdev"

Set the Windows environment variable SRC_DRV to the drive where the "orxdev"
directory is located : SET SRC_DRV=G:

Set the Windows environment variable CPU to IX86 : SET CPU=IX86

Extend the Windows PATH so that the KILL.EXE will be found in orxdev.
KILL.EXE is used to destroy the RXAPI.EXE from memory during the build process

Edit "MAKEORX.BAT" and change SRC_DIR to the build directory
e.g. SET SRC_DIR=\orxdev

Edit "ORXDB.BAT" and change SRC_DIR to the build directory
e.g. SET SRC_DIR=\orxdev

Install Object REXX REXX Interpreter, it will be used during the build process

Open a Windows Command Prompt and change to the build directory

The batch file "MAKEORX.BAT" starts the build process in dependency of the passed parameters.

"makeorx DEBUG"         : Build Object REXX Debug Version of Development and Interpreter Edition.
"makeorx NODEBUG"       : Build Object REXX Release Version of Development and Interpreter Edition.
"makeorx BOTH"          : Build die Object REXX Debug ande Release Version of Development and Interpreter Edition.

Note: The code for the Object REXX workbench is not included. In this case the Development Edition means,
that OODialog is to be build.

After the build is completed the target files (obj, exe, dll,..) are placed with in the directories

Win32Rel     : Object REXX Release version
Win32Dbg     : Object REXX Debug version

In each directory corresponding output file *.log is crated which contains the
output of the build process.
