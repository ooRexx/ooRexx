  1.  ooDialog - Dialog Control Example Programs
  -----------------------------------------------

  This directory contains example programs that demonstrate how to use the
  various dialog control objects in ooDialog.  It is intended that,
  eventually there will be an example of all the control objects.  The
  programs are intended to cover most of the methods of the control objects.
  This will probably cause them to be medium complex.

    - upDown.rex

    Demonstrates how to use the UpDown class.  An up down control is a pair
    of arrow buttons that the user can click to increment or decrement a
    value, such as a scroll position or a number displayed in a companion
    control.
